# Data-Mine-work
Includes all my work with the first year course TDM 101. In this year we learn R and Python. The first semester I learned R. Second semester I will learn Python. I will keep adding my projects to this repository to show what I learned in class through these projects. If you go into the "Learning R" or "Learning Python" folders there will be projects listed to demonstate what I have learned. The .ipynb files are Jupyter Notebooks where I explored different datasets in order to accomplish a certain task set forth by the TDM 101 professor, [Dr. Ward](https://the-examples-book.com/personal/mdw/cv) .
